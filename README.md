Healthy Eating Behavior Analysis Overview

This project explores patterns in healthy eating habits using a dataset containing 2,000 detailed meal records. The analysis focuses on nutrient composition, dietary preferences, cooking styles, and health ratings to uncover factors that influence overall meal healthiness. The primary aim is to derive insights and recommendations for better meal planning and nutrition awareness.
